',\n '1.  Definitions. ',\n 'b. ',\n 'c. ',\n 'd. ',\n 'e. ',\n 'f. ',\n 'hours. ',\n 'a. ',\n '“Emergency Maintenance” means downtime of the Services outside of the Scheduled Maintenance Window hours that is required to ',\n 'complete the application of urgent patches or fixes, or to undertake other urgent maintenance activities. If Emergency Maintenance is ',\n 'required, COMPANY will immediately contact Client and provide the expected start time of the Emergency Maintenance, its planned ',\n 'duration, and whether COMPANY expects the Services to be unavailable during the Emergency Maintenance. ',\n '“Monthly Subscription Fee” means one-twelfth of the annual fee applicable to the Services. ',\n '“Scheduled Maintenance Window” means the window during which scheduled maintenance of the Services may be performed. There ',\n 'is generally one Scheduled Maintenance Window monthly (currently, the first Friday in the month from 6 PM until 10 PM (Central ',\n 'time)). COMPANY will provide Client with a minimum of five business days advance notification of any Scheduled Maintenance ',\n 'Window. The notification will include the expected start time and duration of the Scheduled Maintenance Window activity. ',\n 'COMPANY will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule any Scheduled Maintenance Window activity during off-business ',\n '“Service Credit” means the percentage of the Monthly Services Fee that is awarded to Client for a validated claim related to failure to ',\n 'meet the System Availability objective during that month. ',\n '“Service Level Agreement” is specified in Section 3 (“System Availability Service Level Agreement”) of this Exhibit B. ',\n '“System Availability” means the percentage of total time during which the Services are available to Client, excluding the Scheduled ',\n 'Maintenance Window and Emergency Maintenance. ',\n '2.  General Terms Applicable to the Service Level Agreement for the Services. ',\n 'a. ',\n 'Service Credits. Service Credits earned by Client hereunder will be applied against fees next due for the Services. If Service Credits ',\n 'cannot be applied to future fees due for the Services because the Agreement has expired or been terminated, COMPANY will promptly ',\n 'pay Client the amount of the credit, provided Client will not receive a refund if COMPANY has terminated the Agreement for Client’s ',\n 'material uncured breach. ',\n 'b. ',\n 'Service Level Agreement Claims. ',\n 'Services. ',\n 'Client will have the remedies under this Service Level Agreement commencing 30 days after implementation and go-live of the ',\n 'Client must notify COMPANY via email to support@COMPANY.com within five business days from the date of the incident ',\n 'Client first believes entitles it to receive a remedy under this Service Level Agreement set forth below. ',\n 'iii. ',\n 'All claims for failure to meet the Service Level Agreement are subject to validation by COMPANY. To validate a claim, ',\n 'COMPANY will use log files, database records, audit logs, and any other available information as the basis for making a good ',\n 'faith judgment on the applicability of Service Credits to said incident. Upon Client’s request, COMPANY will make information ',\n 'used to validate a claim available for auditing by Client. ',\n 'iv. ',\n 'The remedies set forth herein represent Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for COMPANY’ breach of the Service Level ',\n 'Agreement defined in this Exhibit. ',\n 'c. ',\n 'Exclusions. ',\n 'Client will not have any remedies under this Service Level Agreement in connection with any force majeure event. ',\n 'Client will not have any remedies under this Service Level Agreement to the extent a Service Credit claim is due to: (A) use of ',\n 'the Services outside the scope described in the Agreement, (B) Client’s equipment and/or third party software, hardware or ',\n 'network infrastructure outside of COMPANY’ data center and not under the direct control of COMPANY, (C) failure of Client to ',\n 'meet the configuration requirements for Client equipment specified by COMPANY, (D) failure of the external internet beyond ',\n 'COMPANY’ network, (E) any inappropriate actions or inactions of Client or any other third party not under the direct control of ',\n 'COMPANY, or (F) attacks (i.e. hacks, denial of service attacks, malicious introduction of viruses and disabling devices) caused by ',\n 'third parties, provided COMPANY has taken all reasonable steps to prevent such attacks.

While COMPANY will also generate support requests based on relevant information reported by the Key Contact over the phone or by email, note that support requests submitted by email are automatically classified as a Severity 4 Defect.',\n '\\tBy Self Service Request via the Client Portal: To submit an issue through the Client Portal, the Key Contact logs into the Client Portal User Center and completes the request form with all relevant information about the issue. Upon submission, COMPANY will generate a support request.',\n '\\tBy Telephone: Once connected with an COMPANY representative, the Key Contact identifies to COMPANY the Client’s name, location, issue, and other data as requested so that COMPANY is able to generate a support request.',\n 'By Email: Upon receipt of an email request from the Key Contact, COMPANY will generate a support request.',\n '\\tDesignation of Key Contacts. COMPANY will provide support to Client only by communication with the technical contacts designated by Client in the Client Portal (each, a \"Key Contact\"). Key Contacts may be changed at any time by updating the Customer account information in the Client Portal. Each Key Contact must have the relevant technical knowledge regarding the Services necessary to assist COMPANY as needed.',\n 'Help Desk Support. COMPANY’ customer support help desk provides assistance to the Designated Support Contacts on use and problem resolution issues with respect to the Services. The customer support help desk is available during the hours between 8:00\\n\\na.m. and 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on regular business days (excluding standard COMPANY holidays, a list of which will be provided by COMPANY to Customer upon request). COMPANY may change the hours during which the help desk is available but will not shorten the hours of support per day.',\n '\\tReporting and Resolving Issues with the Services. Resolution of submitted issues with the Services will depend upon a complete understanding of the variables unique to each situation with both parties working together to identify and resolve the issue.',\n '\\tSeverity Levels and Issue Identification. Services issues are categorized by COMPANY into one of four classifications:',\n '\"Severity 1\" – Services is inoperable. Client is unable to use the Services without significant disruption to Customer’s primary business operations and with respect to which no workarounds exist that would enable the Services to be so used until corrections can be made.',\n '\"Severity 2\" – issue that is of a severity that prevents the Services from being used without significant disruption to Client’s primary business operations but with respect to which a workaround exists enabling business operations even if in a diminished capacity.',\n '\"Severity 3\" – issue which restricts the use of one or more features of the Services to perform necessary functions but with respect to which a workaround is available.',\n '\"Severity 4\" – are non-critical issue that prevent a function or component of the Services from operating properly but which is not a Severity 1, Severity 2 or Severity 3 issue.',\n '\\tProblem Reporting. Client will promptly notify COMPANY regarding issues with the Services through the Client Portal, by telephone or by email as described above. When submitting any request for support, the Key Contact will follow the problem reporting procedures posted by COMPANY in the Client Portal. These procedures include identifying the Severity Level of the issue pursuant to the above classification scheme and providing a clear description of the issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt COMPANY’ request, the Key Contact will provide additional data to facilitate COMPANY in reproducing the issue. Examples of data that may be requested include a description of the expected behavior and the frequency with which the issue occurs.\\n\\nCOMPANY will attempt to reproduce the issue and identify its cause. If COMPANY is able to reproduce the issue, COMPANY’ response will include a confirmation of the Severity Level of the issue for the purpose of developing a resolution and any proposed work-around.\\n\\nIn the event COMPANY determines that the issue is, in fact, not an issue with the Services, but Customer disagrees with that determination, COMPANY and Client will work together to resolve the difference. This may include, but is not limited to,\\n\\nCOMPANY’ demonstrating to Customer why COMPANY does not believe that the issue is with the Services.\\n\\nCOMPANY and Client may revise the Severity classification of the issue based on additional information provided by Client or uncovered during the resolution process.',\n '\\tIssue Resolution. COMPANY’ response and resolution targets are set forth in the table on the following page. However, resolution times will vary depending on the exact issue and customer environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTarget Time Frames 1\\n\\nSeverity Level of Issue2\\n\\nInitial Response 3\\n\\nWorkaround or Temporary Fix\\n\\nFinal Resolution\\n\\n1\\n\\n30 minutes\\n\\nEight hours\\n\\nFive days\\n\\n2\\n\\n30 minutes\\n\\nTwo days\\n\\nFive days\\n\\n3\\n\\n30 minutes\\n\\nFive days\\n\\nNext general release\\n\\n4\\n\\n30 minutes\\n\\nN/A4\\n\\nN/A4',\n '1\\tTarget time frames are measured from creation of a case number per the process described above. Since Defects may not be resolvable within a specific timeframe due to complexity of the solution and other factors, resolution targets are goals and not commitments. The use of the terms “hours” and “days” refer to \"business hours\" and \"business days,\" are based on COMPANY’ regular business schedule, and exclude weekends and COMPANY locally-observed holidays.',\n '2\\tSupport requests submitted by email are automatically classified as a Severity 4 Defect.',\n '3\\tWhen a customer submits a problem report through the Client Portal at clients.COMPANY.com, the acknowledgement will generally be under five minutes. When possible, a solution or a workaround will also be provided.',\n \"4\\tNo guarantee of resolution.\\n\\nCOMPANY provides routine updates on resolution efforts.\\n\\nSpecifically, with respect to Severity 1 issues, COMPANY will use continuous and diligent efforts until Client is back in production. Otherwise, all Target Time Frames which fall outside of COMPANY’ normal business hours will be carried over to the next business day.\\n\\nCOMPANY endeavors to investigate and correct issues at COMPANY’ offices. If COMPANY is unable to do so, and provided the suspected issue is not attributable, in whole or in part, to any of the excluded causes specified below, then upon Client’s request, COMPANY may travel to Client's location to investigate the issue with travel and other out-of-pocket expenses included as part of Maintenance Services. If, after COMPANY travels to the Client location, the suspected issue is determined to be unrelated to the Services, the problem resolution will be Client’s responsibility and Client agrees to pay any travel expenses in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation (FTR)/Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), as applicable. Client shall only be liable for such travel expenses as approved as by Ordering Activity and funded under the applicable ordering document. COMPANY will have discretion as to the method and manner of maintenance and support efforts, including the use of non-COMPANY personnel.\",\n '\\tEscalation.',\n 'Escalation Initiation. Escalation may be initiated for a Severity 1 or Severity 2 issue from either COMPANY or Client via the escalation path provided by COMPANY.',\n 'Escalation Criteria. COMPANY’ escalation criteria for a Severity 1 or Severity 2 issue are as follows:',\n '\\tSeverity 1 issue – If the issue has not resolved within one business day and provided no material progress has been made, the issue is escalated within COMPANY for additional action and resources as needed. Executive management monitors the issues closely until it is resolved.',\n '\\tSeverity 2 issue – escalated after three business days.',\n '\\tManagement of Updates to the Services. COMPANY provides and manages all updates to maintain the Services at the latest version. COMPANY will notify Client prior to implementing an update that may materially affect the function or performance of the Services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport for the Services does not include any services to implement or test the update, to setup or configure the update relative to Client’s instance or to migrate Client Data. Services are available on a time-and-materials basis to assist Client with these.',\n '\\tConditions and Limitations of Support. COMPANY has no obligations to render support for the Services with respect to problems in the use or functioning of the Services caused by any hardware or software product other than the Services, by any error in the use of the Services inconsistent with its authorized use, or by any modifications of the Services by any person or entity other than one authorized by COMPANY.
